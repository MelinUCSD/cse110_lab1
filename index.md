### About me
I'm Matias Lin and I'm currently in my third year studtying bioinformatics. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I lived there basically my whole life before moving here for college. I'm really interested in machine learning and its potential in the area of biology. I'm currently working as a research assistant at UCSD Health in the Alexandrov's Lab, where I'm in charge to optimize one of the pipelines so that we can better diagnose different kinds of cancer. In order to do so, I'm utilizing a machine learning approach that involves CNNs to reduce the resources needed to execute the pipeline.
One of the recent command lines that I've used is the following:
```
shuf -n 10 -e *.vcf | xargs -i mv {} data/
```

### Favorite food
Having lived in Argentina for more than 17 years, it is not surprising that I have a big list of favorite foods. Here are the descriptions of a few of my favorite foods.

**_Milanesa Napolitana_** is similar to veal parmesan, but with South American touches. After the steak is breaded and fried, it's topped with a slice of ham, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese, and served with french fries. Leftovers make great sandwiches, especially when paired with a soft but crusty roll. ~~Milanesa a la Napolitana does not originate from Milan or Naples~~; it's thought to have been invented in the 1940s at a Buenos Aires. When I was in Argentina we used to say: 
> "Che, querés ir a comer una *napo*"?

**_Empanadas_** are hand-sized savory pies that can be found all over South America. In Argentina, every province has its own variety. All follow the same basic culinary guideline — a soft pocket of dough that’s stuffed with a scrumptious, savory filling. There are a lot of variations to this kind of food but some of my favorites have the following fillings: "*carne picante*" and "*humita*".
