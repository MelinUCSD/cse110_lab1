### About me
I'm Matias Lin and I'm currently in my third year studtying bioinformatics. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I lived there basically my whole life before moving here for college. 

### Favorite food
Having lived in Argentina for more than 17 years, it is not surprising that I collected quite a few of my favorite foods. This page will give provide you with a description of different Argentinian plates along with a simple recipe.

**Milanesa Napolitana**
*Milanesa napolitana* is similar to veal parmesan, but with South American touches. After the steak is breaded and fried, it's topped with a slice of ham, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese, and served with french fries. Leftovers make great sandwiches, especially when paired with a soft but crusty roll. ~~Milanesa a la Napolitana does not originate from Milan or Naples~~; it's thought to have been invented in the 1940s at a Buenos Aires. When I was in Argentina we used to say: 
> "Che, querés ir a comer una *napo*"?

**Empanadas**
*Empanadas* are hand-sized savory pies that can be found all over South America. In Argentina, every province has its own variety. All follow the same basic culinary guideline — a soft pocket of dough that’s stuffed with a scrumptious, savory filling. There are a lot of variations to this kind of food but some of my favorites have the following fillings: "*carne picante*" and "*humita*".
