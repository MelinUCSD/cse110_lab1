## My favorite food from Argentina

**Milanesa Napolitana**
*Milanesa Napolitana* is one of the most common kinds of comfort food. Milanesa napolitana is similar to veal parmesan, but with South American touches. After the steak is breaded and fried, it's topped with a slice of ham, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese, and served with french fries. Leftovers make great sandwiches, especially when paired with a soft but crusty roll. ~~Milanesa a la Napolitana does not originate from Milan or Naples~~; it's thought to have been invented in the 1940s at a Buenos Aires. When I was in Argentina we used to say: 
> "Che, querÃ©s ir a comer una *napo*"?
